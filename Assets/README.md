Netflix Landing Page Clone
This project is a responsive clone of Netflix's official landing page, built using HTML and CSS to closely mimic the original UI design. It focuses on replicating the structure, layout, and styling of Netflix's homepage, including a navigation bar, hero section with background image, call-to-action buttons, and footer.

The goal of this project was to practice frontend web development, sharpen HTML/CSS skills, and improve design-to-code conversion ability by replicating a real-world UI.
